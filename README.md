Data cleaning is done to remove missing values, handle outliers, and ensure that the data is in the correct format for analysis. This step ensures the data is ready for further exploration and analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
The project uses descriptive and statistical methods to explore the dataset, including pivot tables in Excel and data manipulation in Python's Jupyter Notebook. EDA is crucial to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data.

**Modeling and Analysis:**
Excel and Python are used to generate outputs from the survey data, providing insights into various aspects such as satisfaction with facilities and professor accessibility. Tools like pivot tables and Jupyter notebooks are employed to analyze and summarize the data.

**Results and Findings:**
Insights are derived from both Excel and Python-based analysis, where data is categorized and findings related to campus facilities, student engagement, diversity, and technology resources are presented.

**Communication of Results:**
The results are visualized and summarized in tables and graphs, showing how different factors impact students' campus experiences.

**About the Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is soucred from conducting a survey to assess the college campus experience using
